# Fast_Food-Analysis
Created an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze the nutritional composition of fast food items, focusing on key indicators like calories, sugar, sodium, and protein. 
The dashboard uses a storytelling approach: starting with an overview of nutritional averages, followed by category-wise comparisons using Donut, Bar, and Waterfall charts, and ending with a Matrix Table for detailed nutrient analysis. Slicer cards enable user-driven filtering, helping viewers identify unhealthy items and supporting data-backed dietary recommendations for menu improvement.
